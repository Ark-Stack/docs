# **ArkStack - Build and Debug AI Agents with Ease**

## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Purpose**
This RFC outlines the design and implementation of **ArkStack** that integrates **[Chidori](https://github.com/ThousandBirdsInc/chidori)**, a reactive runtime for orchestrating agentic goals, with **[smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents)**, a lightweight library for building auto generating code-driven AI agents. The goal of this is to provide developers with a **flexible, efficient, and transparent framework** for creating AI agents that can interact with the real world, solve complex tasks, and adapt..

By combining Chidori’s **advanced runtime features**—such as **pause/resume**, **time-travel debugging**, and **execution graph visualization**—with smolagents’ **code generation** and **tool integration** capabilities, we adress key challenges in agent development and unlock new powerful features for **multi-step, multi-agent systems**. This integration allows devs to build **understandable, secure, and transparent agents** that can handle real-world complex use-case with ease.

--- 

### **1.2 What is Chidori?**

   - Chidori enables developers to understand what an agent is doing and how it arrived at a given state through **time-travel debugging** and **visual execution graphs**.  

2. **Pause and Resume Execution**:  
   - Developers can pause agent execution, interact with the system (e.g., inject human feedback), and resume execution seamlessly.  

3. **Handling Complex State-Space Exploration**:  
   - Chidori supports **branching** and **reverting execution**, allowing developers to explore different outcomes from a given state.  

4. **Monitoring and Observability**:  
   - Chidori logs all state transitions and actions, providing a comprehensive audit trail for debugging and analysis.  

5. **Code Interpreter Environments**:  
   - Chidori supports secure execution of Python and JavaScript code, with restrictions on imports and operations to prevent malicious behavior.  

Chidori’s **reactive runtime** and **visual debugging interface** make it an ideal platform for orchestrating complex agent workflows, especially in enterprise environments where **reliability** and **observability** are critical.

### **1.3 What is smolagents?**
**[smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents)** is a lightweight library for building **code-driven AI agents**. It focuses on simplicity and efficiency, enabling developers to create powerful agents in just a few lines of code. Key features of smolagents include:

1. **Code-Driven Agents**:  
   - smolagents’ `CodeAgent` generates and executes Python code to perform actions, offering greater flexibility and efficiency compared to traditional JSON-based tool calls.  

2. **Tool Integration**:  
   - smolagents supports integration with a wide range of tools, including web search APIs, image generation APIs, and custom APIs.  

3. **Multi-Agent Systems**:  
   - smolagents enables hierarchical multi-agent systems through the `ManagedAgent` class, allowing agents to collaborate on complex tasks.  

4. **Security and Sandboxing**:  
   - smolagents provides secure execution environments, such as the **local Python interpreter** and **E2B sandbox**, to ensure safe execution of generated code.  

smolagents’ **simplicity** and **code-first approach** make it a powerful tool for building AI agents, but it lacks some of the advanced orchestration and debugging features provided by Chidori.

---

### **1.4 Problem Statement**
While both Chidori and smolagents are powerful tools for building AI agents, they address different aspects of the development process:

1. **Chidori’s Limitations**:  
   - Chidori excels at **orchestration** and **debugging** but does not provide native support for **code generation** or **tool integration**.  

2. **smolagents’ Limitations**:  
   - smolagents simplifies **code generation** and **tool integration** but lacks advanced features for **state management**, **debugging**, and **observability**.  

This creates a gap in development:  
- Developers using smolagents struggle with **complex debugging** and **state management**.  
- Developers using Chidori lack a streamlined way to **generate code** and **integrate tools**.  

By integrating Chidori and smolagents, we can bridge this gap and provide a **unified frameowrk** that combines the strengths of both tools. Eg Chidori allows devs to peek behind the curtain and understand what code smolagents generate.

While the platform is designed to be extensible and support broader AI agent concepts, the primary focus is on the integration of Chidori and smolagents.

---

## **2. Architectural Overview**

### **2.1 High-Level Design**
The platform is built around three core components:

1. **ArkStack Runtime**: Manages the execution of agent workflows, including state management, branching, and time-travel debugging.  
2. **smolagents Library**: Provides tools for building code-driven agents, including `CodeAgent` for generating Python code and `ToolCallingAgent` for traditional JSON-based tool calls.  
3. **Execution Environment**: Ensures secure execution of generated code, either through a local Python interpreter with restricted imports or a sandboxed environment like E2B.

These components work together to create a modular and extensible platform for building AI agents.

---

### **2.2 Core Components**
#### **ArkStack Runtime**
- **Reactive Execution**: Agents react to changes in state, enabling dynamic workflows.  
- **Time-Travel Debugging**: Developers can revert to previous states to debug and analyze agent behavior.  
- **Visual Debugging**: A graphical interface for visualizing and manipulating the execution graph.  

#### **smolagents Library**
- **CodeAgent**: Generates and executes Python code for agent actions, offering greater flexibility and efficiency.  
- **Tool Integration**: Supports a wide range of tools, including web search, image generation, and custom APIs.  
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Enables hierarchical agent coordination through the `ManagedAgent` class.  

#### **Execution Environment**
- **Local Python Interpreter**: Executes generated code with restricted imports and capped operations for security.  
- **E2B Sandbox**: Runs code in an isolated container for maximum security.  

---

### **2.3 Workflow**
The platform follows a multi-step workflow for executing agent tasks:

1. **Task Initialization**: The user defines a task, which is passed to the agent.  
2. **Code Generation**: The agent generates Python code to perform the task, leveraging available tools.  
3. **Code Execution**: The code is executed in a secure environment (local or sandboxed), and the results are observed.  
4. **State Management**: The runtime updates the agent’s state and memory based on the results.  
5. **Iteration**: The agent repeats the process until the task is completed or a stopping condition is met.  
6. **Debugging and Analysis**: Developers can use ArkStack’s time-travel debugging and visual interface to analyze the agent’s behavior and optimize its performance.  

---

## **3. Runtime Design (Chidori Integration)**

### **3.1 Reactive Runtime**
The **reactive runtime** is the core of ArkStack, enabling agents to dynamically respond to changes in state. It uses a **graph-based execution model**, where each node represents a state or action, and edges represent transitions between states. This model allows for **pause/resume**, **time-travel debugging**, and **branching** of execution.

#### **Execution Graph**
The execution graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that captures the flow of agent execution. Each node in the graph represents a **state** or **action**, and edges represent **transitions** triggered by changes in state.

```plaintext
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
|   Initial State   | ----> |   Action Node 1   | ----> |   Action Node 2   |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
        |                         |                         |
        v                         v                         v
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
|   State Update    |       |   State Update    |       |   State Update    |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
```

#### **State Transitions**
State transitions are triggered by changes in the system, such as the completion of an action or the arrival of new data. The runtime subscribes to these changes and updates the execution graph accordingly.

#### **Reactive Subscriptions**
Nodes in the execution graph can subscribe to changes in other nodes, enabling **reactive behavior**. For example, a node representing a data processing step can subscribe to changes in a node representing a data source.

---

### **3.2 Pause and Resume**
ArkStack supports **pausing** and **resuming** agent execution, allowing developers to inspect and modify the agent’s state at any point in time. This is particularly useful for **debugging** and **human-in-the-loop workflows**.

#### **Pause Mechanism**
When execution is paused, the runtime captures the current state of the execution graph and stores it. Developers can inspect the state, modify it, or inject new data before resuming execution.

#### **Resume Mechanism**
When execution is resumed, the runtime restores the captured state and continues execution from the point of interruption. Developers can also modify the execution graph before resuming.


#### **Example: Human-in-the-Loop Workflow**
```plaintext
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
|   Running State   | ----> |   Paused State    | ----> |   Resumed State   |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
        |                         |                         |
        v                         v                         v
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
|   Capture State   |       |   User Input      |       |   Restore State   |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
```

---

### **3.3 Monitoring and Observability**
ArkStack provides comprehensive **monitoring** and **observability** by logging all state transitions and actions. This data can be visualized in ArkStack's debugging interface, enabling developers to understand and debug agent behavior.

#### **Logging Mechanism**
The runtime logs the following data for each state transition:
- **Timestamp**: The time of the transition.  
- **Node ID**: The ID of the node triggering the transition.  
- **Event**: The event causing the transition (e.g., "action_completed").  
- **State Data**: The state of the system before and after the transition.  


#### **Visual Debugging**
ArkStack’s debugging interface visualizes the execution graph and logs, allowing developers to inspect the flow of execution and identify issues.

**Example:**
```plaintext
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
|   Initial State   | ----> |   Action Node 1   | ----> |   Action Node 2   |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
        |                         |                         |
        v                         v                         v
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
|   Log Entry 1     |       |   Log Entry 2     |       |   Log Entry 3     |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
```

---


### **3.5 Branching and Time-Travel Debugging**
ArkStack supports **branching** and **time-travel debugging**, allowing developers to explore different execution paths and revert to previous states.

#### **Branching**
Branching creates a copy of the execution graph at a specific state, enabling developers to explore alternative workflows.

**Example:**
```plaintext
+-------------------+       +-------------------+
|   Initial State   | ----> |   Branch Point    |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+
        |                         |
        v                         v
+-------------------+       +-------------------+
|   Path A          |       |   Path B          |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+
```

#### **Time-Travel Debugging**
Time-travel debugging allows developers to revert the execution graph to a previous state, inspect it, and modify it before continuing execution.

**Example:**
```plaintext
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
|   State 1         | ----> |   State 2         | ----> |   State 3         |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
        |                         |                         |
        v                         v                         v
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
|   Revert to State 1       |   Modify State 1  |       |   Continue Execution |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
```

## **4. Code Generation (smolagents Integration)**

### **4.1 Code Agents**
**Code Agents** are a core feature of smolagents, enabling agents to generate and execute Python code to perform actions. This approach offers greater flexibility and efficiency compared to traditional JSON-based tool calls, reducing the number of steps required to complete tasks and improving performance on complex benchmarks.

#### **Code Generation Process**
The code generation process involves the following steps:
1. **Task Analysis**: The agent analyzes the task and identifies the tools and operations required to solve it.  
2. **Code Generation**: The agent generates Python code to perform the identified operations.  
3. **Code Execution**: The generated code is executed in a secure environment (local or sandboxed).  
4. **Result Handling**: The results of the code execution are returned to the agent for further processing.  

#### **Example: Code Agent Workflow**
```plaintext
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
|   Task Input      | ----> |   Code Generation | ----> |   Code Execution  |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
        |                         |                         |
        v                         v                         v
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
|   LLM Engine      |       |   Code Validation |       |   Result Output   |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
```


### **4.2 Tool Integration**
smolagents supports integration with a wide range of tools, including web search APIs, image generation APIs, and custom APIs. These tools are exposed to the agent as Python functions, enabling seamless integration into generated code.

```plaintext
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
|   Task Input      | ----> |   Tool Selection  | ----> |   Code Generation |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
        |                         |                         |
        v                         v                         v
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
|   Tool Registry   |       |   Tool Execution  |       |   Result Output   |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
```

---

### **4.3 Security and Sandboxing**
To ensure safe execution of generated code, smolagents provides **security mechanisms** such as restricted imports and sandboxed environments. This prevents malicious behavior and protects the host system.

#### **Local Python Interpreter**
The local interpreter executes code with **restricted imports** and **capped operations** to prevent unauthorized access to system resources.

**Example: Restricted Imports**
```python
# Allowed imports
import math
import json

# Blocked imports
import os  # Raises SecurityError
```

#### **E2B Sandbox**
The E2B sandbox runs code in an **isolated container**, providing maximum security. This is ideal for executing untrusted code or code that requires access to external resources.

### **4.4 Managed Agents**
smolagents supports **multi-agent systems** through the `ManagedAgent` class, enabling hierarchical coordination of agents. A **manager agent** can coordinate the actions of subordinate agents, each specializing in a specific sub-task.

#### **Managed Agent Workflow**
1. **Task Delegation**: The manager agent delegates sub-tasks to subordinate agents.  
2. **Sub-Task Execution**: Each subordinate agent generates and executes code to perform its assigned sub-task.  
3. **Result Aggregation**: The manager agent aggregates the results from subordinate agents and returns the final output.  

**Example: Multi-Agent Workflow**
```plaintext
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
|   Task Input      | ----> |   Manager Agent   | ----> |   Sub-Agent 1     |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
        |                         |                         |
        v                         v                         v
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
|   Result Output   | <---- |   Sub-Agent 2     | <---- |   Sub-Agent 3     |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
```

---

## **5. Agent Coordination and Communication**

### **5.1 Multi-Agent Systems**
Multi-agent systems involve multiple agents collaborating to solve complex tasks. Each agent specializes in a specific sub-task, improving efficiency and reducing the cognitive load on individual agents. The integration of **smolagents** and **Chidori** provides a robust framework for building and managing such systems.

#### **Key Concepts**
- **Specialization**: Each agent is designed to perform a specific function (e.g., web search, data processing).  
- **Coordination**: A **manager agent** coordinates the actions of subordinate agents, ensuring that sub-tasks are executed in the correct order.  
- **Communication**: Agents communicate through **message passing** or **shared memory**, enabling them to exchange data and results.  

---

### **5.2 smolagents Multi-Agent Workflow**
smolagents supports multi-agent systems through the `ManagedAgent` class, which enables hierarchical coordination of agents. A **manager agent** delegates sub-tasks to subordinate agents and aggregates their results.

#### **Managed Agent Workflow**
1. **Task Delegation**: The manager agent analyzes the task and delegates sub-tasks to subordinate agents.  
2. **Sub-Task Execution**: Each subordinate agent generates and executes code to perform its assigned sub-task.  
3. **Result Aggregation**: The manager agent collects the results from subordinate agents and returns the final output.  

**Example: Multi-Agent Workflow**
```plaintext
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
|   Task Input      | ----> |   Manager Agent   | ----> |   Sub-Agent 1     |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
        |                         |                         |
        v                         v                         v
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
|   Result Output   | <---- |   Sub-Agent 2     | <---- |   Sub-Agent 3     |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
```

**Example Code Snippet:**
```python
from smolagents import ManagedAgent, CodeAgent, DuckDuckGoSearchTool, HfApiModel

# Define subordinate agents
web_agent = CodeAgent(tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchTool()], model=HfApiModel())
data_agent = CodeAgent(tools=[], model=HfApiModel())

# Define manager agent
manager_agent = ManagedAgent(
    agents=[web_agent, data_agent],
    description="Coordinates web search and data processing agents"
)

# Run the multi-agent system
result = manager_agent.run("Analyze the latest AI research papers")
```

### **5.3 ArkStack Support for Multi-Agent Execution**
ArkStack provides **execution tracking** and **observability** for multi-agent systems, enabling developers to monitor and debug the behavior of individual agents and their interactions.

#### **Execution Graph for Multi-Agent Systems**
ArkStack’s **execution graph** captures the flow of execution across multiple agents, including state transitions, task delegations, and result aggregations. Each agent is represented as a node in the graph, and edges represent communication or data flow between agents.

**Example: Execution Graph for Multi-Agent System**
```plaintext
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
|   Manager Agent   | ----> |   Sub-Agent 1     | ----> |   Sub-Agent 2     |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
        |                         |                         |
        v                         v                         v
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
|   Task Delegation |       |   Sub-Task Exec   |       |   Sub-Task Exec   |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
        |                         |                         |
        v                         v                         v
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
|   Result Aggregation <---- |   Result Output   | <---- |   Result Output   |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
```

#### **Monitoring and Debugging**
ArkStack logs all state transitions and interactions between agents, providing a comprehensive audit trail for debugging. Developers can use ArkStack's **time-travel debugging** and **visual interface** to inspect the execution graph and identify issues.

---

### **5.4 Communication Protocols**
Agents communicate using **message passing** or **shared memory**, depending on the requirements of the task. ArkStack ensures that communication is tracked and logged for observability.

#### **Message Passing**
In message passing, agents exchange data through explicit messages. This approach is ideal for loosely coupled systems where agents operate independently.

**Example: Message Passing**
```plaintext
Agent A -> Message -> Agent B
Agent B -> Result -> Agent A
```

#### **Shared Memory**
In shared memory, agents access a common data structure to exchange information. This approach is ideal for tightly coupled systems where agents need to collaborate closely.

**Example: Shared Memory**
```plaintext
Agent A -> Writes Data -> Shared Memory
Agent B -> Reads Data -> Shared Memory
```


### **5.5 Example: Multi-Agent System for Data Analysis**
This example demonstrates a multi-agent system where:
1. A **manager agent** coordinates the workflow.  
2. A **web search agent** retrieves data from the web.  
3. A **data processing agent** analyzes the retrieved data.  

**Workflow:**
```plaintext
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
|   Manager Agent   | ----> |   Web Search Agent| ----> |   Data Processing |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
        |                         |                         |
        v                         v                         v
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
